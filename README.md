1. Project Title
This project is called "My Pokedex" and provides users with an index of 150 Pokemon and their corresponding statistics.

2. Project Description
My Pokedex allows users to browse an index of 150 Pokemon. Users can click on the name of their chosen Pokemon to view an image of the selected Pokemon, as well as their height, and type. Users can also search by name to find a Pokemon in the Pokedex.

My Pokedex was created using the Application Programme Interface (API) "Pokeapi"( https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/). This provided the database of information related to the Pokemon in the Pokedex.
JavaScript was used in order to load the API Pokeapi, as well as providing interactive elements on the webpage such as the modals which appear when a Pokemon name is clicked on.
HTML and CSS were used to design the layout of the webpage.
jQuery was implemented into the project to simplify the JavaScript code needed to be written.
Bootstrap was used in order to add responsive features, namely the Bootsrap Grid.

While working on the project, I was able learn how to use an external API for my project, as well as gaining experience in writing JavaScript code. In addition, I gained further practise in using HTML and CSS code in order to produce an attractive looking webpage.
Bootstrap allowed me to create a webpage that is responsive on both mobile and desktop devices, which is something I aim for in all my projects.
In the future, I hope to continue to improve the appearance of my webpage using UI libraries and with more experience in CSS.

3. How to use this app
Users can find the My Pokedex on their browser under the link: https://hanvonwolf.github.io/pokedex-js-app/.
Clicking on a Pokemon's name presents a model displaying the Pokemon's name, image, height and type. Users can search for a Pokemon by typing its name into the searchbar.
